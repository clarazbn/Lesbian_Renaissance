# **Lesbian Renaissance**

## **Description**
This project analyzes the evolution of lesbian visibility on TV from the 1970s to 2022. I have put together a database of over 500 movies and tv shows that feature sapphic characters or stories to visualize the evolution of lesbian presence on broadcast TV. I have also compiled data from GLAAD's "Where We Are" reports to compare the visibility of gay men and lesbians since 2015. The aim of this project was to investigate the recent surge of wlw culture in mainstream media, or what ELLE Magazine contributor Sophie Wilkinson called a [Lesbian Renaissance](https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a61452046/lesbian-renaissance-revolution/).

## **Findings**
My project highlights that over the last 25 years, significantly more lesbian characters and stories have been portrayed on TV. But it also finds that this greater visibility doesn't necessarily mean that young lesbians stopped feeling the pressures of a heteronormative society - 80% still feel ashamed to be part of the LGBTQ+ community, according to [Just Like Us](https://www.justlikeus.org/blog/2023/04/24/lesbian-visibility-week-research/).

## **Data-collection process**
I have created my main database of sapphic visibility by scrapping four different databases: [Lesbian Representation Evolution in Mainstream Media](https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/lesbians-representation-evolution-in-mainstream-media-2151-6200-1000201.pdf) ; [Sapphic Stories Database](https://sapphicnation.com/films/?_ga=2.248958663.1122788871.1720263497-278540631.1720263497&_gl=1*103yhsz*_ga*Mjc4NTQwNjMxLjE3MjAyNjM0OTc.*_ga_C27749276V*MTcyMDI2MzQ5Ni4xLjEuMTcyMDI2NTcxNC41OS4wLjA.) ; [List of Lesbian characters in television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lesbian_characters_in_television) ; [List of dramatic television series with LGBTQ characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dramatic_television_series_with_LGBT_characters:_2020s#).

I manually collected data on lesbian vs gay representation in GLAAD's [Where We Are](https://glaad.org/whereweareontv23/) 2015-2022 reports.
I collected [Just Like Us](https://www.justlikeus.org/blog/2023/04/24/lesbian-visibility-week-research/)'s data on lesbian shame manually on their blog.
I scrapped a [Business Insider list](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-films-of-the-decade-2010-2019-11#zero-dark-thirty-director-kathryn-bigelow-2012-15) of the best movies of the 2010s and a [The AV Club list](https://www.avclub.com/the-100-best-movies-of-the-2010s-1839846306) of the best tv shows of the 2010s and crossreferenced them with my main tv show/movie database.

I have analyzed my data using Excel and Datawrapper.

## **Skills**
This project was my first real web-scrapping and data-analysis experience and I feel like I was able to grow my skills in these areas. I was also able to learn how to use Datawrapper and Illustrator better.
I would have really loved to build an even more complete TV shows and movies database and visualize it in an interactive chart organized by parameters such as race, gender, and positive vs negative sapphic storyline (and also take bisexual women more into account).
